# My journey towards software development

Do you hold a tech degree and still struggling to get into your first job? Are you depressed for the same reason? Do you think you can't make it happen?

Above questions are common for those who are just starting their career. But have you ever thought just the opposite side of the angle? Do you know that there are a lot of engineer out there who doesn't hold any tech degree? It doesn't applies for only tech industry. If you see other industry as well you will see there are lot of peoples who doesn't hold degree which requires for that particular job.

Yes I can proudly say that I doesn't hold any tech degree and yet a software developer. And if I can why not you? With that note I'm starting to give you a brief about my career...

## Initial stage

My journey started when I first started learning basics of computer applications when I was in 12th standard. That is the time when I got the introduction of world of computer. I got knowledge on basics of files, folders, MS applications, DOS and many more basic things. That's the time when I got huge interest towards learning more things and also became so much curious about how the applications are running, how softwares being made?

## Glimpse of Web

After finishing that basic degree I joined a multimedia class where the courses included were Photoshop, Flash, Basic of HTML, CSS and javascript and few more things which I don't really remember right now. From there we 3 friends decided to join the teacher's class who used to teach us in the multimedia class for getting more knowledge on the Web part. We really didn't think that what would happen if we join and what wouldn't, because there was no one that to tell us what's best and what's not. We just joined the personal class for the sack of interest, nothing else.

## World of Web

We started going to the web class. This is the time when there was passion building up inside us. We used to learn like a hell. The interest and passion we built up that time, it was immense. We were trying get everything from that teacher, whatever was possible. The part is that we 3 started seeing us as competitor. We literally started compete each other in the process of learning. The teacher also was great because he used to push us towards the fact that "We can do". And we always will be thankful to that teacher.

## Landed into my first job

I basically hail from Kolkata, India which basically a state city of West Bengal. I can remember that we had given 8 to 10 interviews and got rejected from everywhere. We had knowledge that time but companies used to reject sometime because of the tech degree, sometime we used to do lot of silly mistakes. Lot of time we did mistakes which was not acceptable. There are lot of fun things happened during that time. But finally we were getting rejected continuously from almost all the company. I almost quit my dream.
