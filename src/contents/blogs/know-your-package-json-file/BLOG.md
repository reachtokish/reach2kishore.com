# Know your package.json file

Whoever has worked with any front-end application which is related to node or npm there should be a file called `package.json` where we generally keep all the configuration related to our project. When I started working with Angular and React I was not much bothered about that particular file because that does not have direct intervention in my project. As a front-end developer your main task is to make the look and feel as good as possible with high performance keeping in mind. So why I would bother about package.json file?

But there are many cases where you have to modify some of the lines in that file. On that note you have to have that knowledge so that you can play around with it.

I will be discussing some of the generic configuration which generally resides in package.json file. There could be any kind of information you can keep like testing related or your project specific anything but we can can't cover all of them because in that case list will never end.

Without much reading will directly jump to the list which have to know
